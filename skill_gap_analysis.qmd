**Objective:** Compare the skills required in IT job postings against the actual skills of your group members to identify knowledge gaps and areas for improvement.

## Create a team-based skill dataframe

Each team member should list their current skills relevant to their selected IT career path.
Use a numerical scale (1-5) to indicate proficiency levels:

***Note***: Each team member has been given a fictional score to better demonstrate the variations in proficiency level.

- 1 = Beginner
- 2 = Basic knowledge
- 3 = Intermediate
- 4 = Advanced
- 5 = Expert

```{python}
import pandas as pd

skills_data = {
    "Name": ["Thomas", "Fayobomi", "Dominique", "Aryan"],
    "Python": [1, 2, 4, 5],
    "SQL": [2, 3, 3, 4],
    "Machine Learning": [1, 2, 4, 4],
    "Cloud Computing": [1, 2, 3, 5]
}

df_skills = pd.DataFrame(skills_data)
df_skills.set_index("Name", inplace=True)
df_skills

```

You can use heatmaps or any other visualizations to visualize team strengths and gaps.

### 
Visualizing Skill Gaps with Seaborn
```{python}
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(df_skills, annot=True, cmap="coolwarm", linewidths=0.5)
plt.title("Team Skill Levels Heatmap")
plt.show()
```


### Compare team skills to industry requirements
Extract most in-demand skills from IT job postings.
Identify gaps between team skill levels and job expectations.

## Extracting Top Skills from Job Descriptions
```{python}
from collections import Counter

#Assuming job_descriptions is a list of text from job postings
top_skills = ["Python", "SQL", "Machine Learning", "Cloud Computing", "Docker", "AWS"]
job_skill_counts = Counter(top_skills)

# Compare with team skill levels
for skill in top_skills:
    if skill not in df_skills.columns:
        df_skills[skill] = 0  # Assume no knowledge in missing skills

df_skills

```

## Improvement Plan
Which skills should each member prioritize learning?
What courses or resources can help?
How can the team collaborate to bridge skill gaps?
