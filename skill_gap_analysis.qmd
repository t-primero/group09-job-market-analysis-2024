**Objective:** Compare the skills required in IT job postings against the actual skills of your group members to identify knowledge gaps and areas for improvement.

## Create a team-based skill dataframe

Each team member should list their current skills relevant to their selected IT career path.
Use a numerical scale (1-5) to indicate proficiency levels:

Note: Each team member has been given a fictional score, to demonstrate the variations in expertise level.

- 1 = Beginner
- 2 = Basic knowledge
- 3 = Intermediate
- 4 = Advanced
- 5 = Expert

```{python}
import pandas as pd

skills_data = {
    "Name": ["Thomas", "Fayobomi", "Dominique", "Aryan"],
    "Python": [1, 2, 4, 5],
    "SQL": [2, 3, 3, 4],
    "Machine Learning": [1, 2, 4, 4],
    "Cloud Computing": [1, 2, 3, 5]
}

df_skills = pd.DataFrame(skills_data)
df_skills.set_index("Name", inplace=True)
df_skills

```
