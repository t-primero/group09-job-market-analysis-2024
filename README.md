## 📋 Project Overview

This project analyzes **geographic trends and remote work patterns** in the U.S. job market, comparing opportunities in AI-related careers versus traditional non-AI careers. Using Lightcast job postings data from 2024, we examine how location and remote work availability shape employment opportunities in the evolving labor market.

### Research Questions

1. **Geographic Job Growth**: Which cities or states have the highest job growth for AI vs. non-AI careers?

2. **Remote Work Trends**: Are remote jobs increasing or decreasing across industries?

3. **Tech Hub Dominance**: Do traditional tech hubs (Silicon Valley, Austin, Boston) still dominate hiring, or are other locations emerging?

4. **Urban vs. Rural Markets**: How do urban and rural job markets differ for AI and non-AI careers?
